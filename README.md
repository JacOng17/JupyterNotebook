## Getting started

### Step 1: Clone the repo

### Step 2: Install python using pyenv

We want to use the exact version of python this project recommends.

```sh
 pyenv install < .python-version
```

To check the current version after installation:

```sh
 python --version # This should match the version in .python-version file
```

### Step 3: Install Dev dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
